# Your Mom's Theme | A Dark Theme for Discourse 3.0

## Installation
https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682

Basically pretty easy and straight forward:

1. Go to Admin
2. Customize
3. Themes
4. Import
5. From the web > github repro URL:
https://github.com/hackdefendr/your-mom-discourse-dark-theme
6. Adjust as you wish. A Color Scheme is inclusive

## Additional feature: Theme Switcher
Included is a theme switcher at the top Discourse Header where people can choose between a Light (default) Theme and this Dark theme.
I set a global modifier class in the html and store it in the local Storage. 
This way it is permanent and can react properly.

## SUPPORT
There is no support as I stole this theme for myself. I expect others to do the same :)
